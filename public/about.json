  "bio": "Hello! My name is David Lee, I am a full-stack developer with a versatile background in marketing, project management, and software development. After obtaining my BA in International Business from UC San Diego in 2017, I spent the next 5 years in the marketing and project management field. However, my passion for technology, especially for gaming and computer building, inspired me to pursue a career in software development. I took the leap and enrolled in a full-time coding bootcamp, General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program. I successfully graduated in early February 2023 with a newfound skillset and a deep appreciation for the power of software development. When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring my creative side through photography and staying active through Brazilian Jiu-jitsu. I bring a unique combination of technical skills, professional experience, and a passionate approach to any project. I am eager to start the next chapter in my career and I am open to work opportunities. Thank you for your consideration!"
